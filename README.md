# Hack Club Puzzle Lab

The best way to learn is by making things you care about and sharing them with others.  

## Development

We use vite for development.

Clone repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hackclub/puzzlelab/
```

Start a local HTTP server inside the repo:

```
$ cd puzzlelab/
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000> in your web browser and it should work!

## TODO

### now
- [ ] fullscreen the game
- [ ] style the upload flow
- [ ] monkeypatch `setInterval`
- [ ] preview maps
- [x] previews don't update accordingly
- [ ] simplify api
  - single character references are confusing
  - matching and replacing can be done manually, more programmatic in a way
  - how to handle maps with multiple sprites in one tile
- [ ] map editor
  - [x] render combos
  - [x] add rows and columns
  - [x] under certain conditions editor sets text in wrong range

### at some point

- [ ] first line bitmap not previewed
- [ ] feedback on user inputs
- [ ] better error logging
- [ ] console
- [ ] When typing in browser console get: "Possible side-effect in debug-evaluate" (add error event handler)
- [ ] play on phone

### maybe

- [ ] use index of legend as key in map
- [ ] make legend, solids, tilesWith all variadic instead of taking lists

- [ ] add ability to delete saved files
- [ ] Across all editors, right click to erase
- [ ] Exporting:
  - [ ] HTML
  - [ ] Link
- [ ] Remove set size function
- [ ] Make sure everything matches docs in general
- [ ] BPM isn't a thing anymore, fix that
- [ ] Are stacks exclusive or inclusive? Do they replace the whole cell?
- [ ] Why does replacePattern return a boolean and not a count?
- [ ] Does `addSprite` add to the front or the back?
- [ ] Should we get rid of all the old Game Lab remnants?
- [ ] Does patternMap match stack behavior (can you pass a single *or* an array)?
- [ ] Warning when interpolating in tags
- [ ] GFM blockquote support
- [ ] Code highlighting (should match CodeMirror?)
- [ ] Styles for blockquotes
- [ ] Styles for images
- [ ] Interactive table of contents
- [ ] Backwards compatibility / tile engine
- [ ] Example games / gallery
- [ ] Since docs have moved, the README feels quite skeleton-like... what can we do to improve this?
  - [ ] Add images!
- [ ] Screen sizes
- [ ] Non-cursor interactions for ipad and chromebook
- [ ] Make sure if the mouse is unpressed outside an editor canvas that's registered (we need global listeners and proper cleanups to prevent memory leaks)
- [ ] charactersitic image
- [ ] image gallery
- [ ] load images dropping them in
- [ ] When editing undersized bitmap: "unknown color: undefined" (kog: is this a bug?)
